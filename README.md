What is this repository?
===
It's been a while since I wanted to get myself into the +Game Development* world and so I decided to approach *SFML* starting creating the base for what I would like to accomplish.
So I started to create the Game Engine trying to handle everything it can, from resources to inputs and events.

I hope that what I write can be useful to everyone.
